# Webstore-Flask
a basic webstore developed in Flask, multiple issues with optimization and direct apache integration, more of a PoC to be worked on.

requires python3, flask, flaskwtf and other libs cant be assed naming them. this is full of bugs and if you deploy it in this state i can garantee you will be exploited
in some aspect. deploying with apache is the best option, but you can use nginx and unicorn.

*css was paid for by me, if the original creator has a issue contact me and ill take it down and replace it.*
